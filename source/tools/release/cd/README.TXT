SOFTWARE
* This is a live CD-ROM. You can insert it into your computer and boot from it.
MINIX 3 will start automatically and you can log in as root. It does NOT require
Windows, Linux, or any other operating system as it is self contained. However,
to use it effectively, you must install it on your hard disk. Detailed instal-
lation instructions are given in the SETUP.PDF file. To read this file, you need
the Adobe Acrobat Reader, available for free at http://www.adobe.com/acrobat.
The SETUP.PS file contains the same content in PostScript. Please be sure to
read one of these files before attempting to install MINIX 3 as you must
partition your hard disk before starting and this subject is discussed in the
SETUP files. Disk partitioning must be done very carefully to prevent data loss.
These SETUP files are also available on the MINIX 3 Website: 
http://www.minix3.org/doc. Please have a printed copy of the SETUP file available
while you are doing the installation, as it will be very helpful to you then.

WARNING
* MINIX 3 is an operating system and will overwrite all the data in the
partition in which it is installed. Be sure to back up all your files
before installing it.
